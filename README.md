# AmigaLearning
Going through different online and book tutorials learning how to program for the Amiga series of computers, specifically the A500 
which i have recently restored. Mostly in 68000 ASM but want to get my VBCC cross complier working so i can also use C.

These tutorials are the end result of a video and the starting point for the video number that is in the title. EG Video five result is tutorial 6. 
Or if you are starting video 8 you us tutorial 7

I'm stupid try not to think to hard about it.
